#    This file contains a list of all available settings and their default value for minetest.conf

#    By default, all the settings are commented and not functional.
#    Uncomment settings by removing the preceding #.

#    minetest.conf is read by default from:
#    ../minetest.conf
#    ../../minetest.conf
#    Any other path can be chosen by passing the path as a parameter
#    to the program, eg. "minetest.exe --config ../minetest.conf.example".

#    Use mip mapping to scale textures. May slightly increase performance.

#    Filtered textures can blend RGB values with fully-transparent neighbors,
#    which PNG optimizers usually discard, sometimes resulting in a dark or
#    light edge to transparent textures.  Apply this filter to clean that up
#    at texture load time.

#    When using bilinear/trilinear/anisotropic filters, low-resolution textures
#    can be blurred, so automatically upscale them with nearest-neighbor
#    interpolation to preserve crisp pixels.  This sets the minimum texture size
#    for the upscaled textures; higher values look sharper, but require more
#    memory.  Powers of 2 are recommended.  Setting this higher than 1 may not
#    have a visible effect unless bilinear/trilinear/anisotropic filtering is
#    enabled.
