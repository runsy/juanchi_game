# Minetest Mod: farbows

Just like all the other bow mods but this time with Raycast.

Depends: rcbows, default, farming

## Features

- Place/Rightclick to charge
- Punch/Leftclick to fire

## Bows

- The Wooden and Mese Bows only throw normal arrows.

- The Flaming Bow can throw normal, fire, explosive or water arrows.
If you get several arrows in the inventory, it will be loaded the first one
(in the inventory the order is left-to-right and top-to-down).
